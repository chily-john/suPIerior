# @supierior/feature-workflow

Pi Workflower package for turning feature ideas into reviewed, TDD-first, vertically sliced GitHub issues or implementation plans.

This package depends on `@supierior/workflower` and `@supierior/ruleplementor`; installing it also installs the workflow runtime and Ruleplementor implementation/review skills used by `take-it-away`.

It registers two workflows:

```text
new-feature
take-it-away
```

## `new-feature`

Workflow id: `new-feature`

Use this workflow when you want to clarify a new feature from the beginning, generate reviewed GitHub issues, and publish them.

Artifacts are written under the workflow's flower directory while the workflow is running:

```text
.pi/workflows/<garden>/0001-new-feature/
```

The workflow pins `issues.md` as pollen so downstream flowers in the same garden can receive the reviewed issue artifact without users copying paths manually. The workflow is configured to clean up its workdir on completion.

### Steps

1. `grill` — `/skill:new-feature-grill`
   - asks the user to describe the desired feature;
   - relentlessly clarifies scope, behavior, edge cases, tests, docs, and integration details;
   - preserves conversation context for the next step;
   - does not auto-advance.
2. `summary` — `/skill:new-feature-summary`, writes `feature-summary.md`
   - summarizes the retained conversation into a detailed feature summary;
   - auto-advances.
3. `convert-to-issues-prep` — `/skill:new-feature-convert-to-issues-prep`, writes `issues.md`
   - creates GitHub issue outlines from `feature-summary.md`;
   - emphasizes TDD red/green implementation and vertical slicing;
   - auto-advances.
4. `review-issues` — `/skill:new-feature-review-issues`, updates `issues.md`
   - reviews and corrects issues for TDD, vertical slicing, dependencies, dependents, and labels;
   - auto-advances.
5. `publish-issues` — `/skill:new-feature-publish-issues`
   - creates GitHub issues with the `gh` CLI;
   - updates `issues.md` with created issue URLs;
   - completes the workflow.

### Smoke test

```text
/wf:new-feature demo
```

Complete the grill conversation. When the skill says you have reached a common understanding, run:

```text
/next
```

The remaining steps auto-advance through summary, issue drafting, issue review, and GitHub issue publication.

## `take-it-away`

Workflow id: `take-it-away`

Use this workflow after an organic conversation and exploration phase for a smaller change. It preserves the visible session on start so the first step can summarize the prior context, then clears context between auto-advanced steps so each step works from artifacts.

Artifacts are written under the workflow's flower directory while the workflow is running:

```text
.pi/workflows/<garden>/0001-take-it-away/
```

When started as a downstream flower, this workflow accepts incoming pollen by default. It pins `implementation-review.md` as pollen so another flower can receive the implementation review artifact. The workflow is configured to clean up its workdir on completion.

### Steps

1. `summarize-context` — `/skill:take-it-away-summary`, writes `context-summary.md`
   - captures the previous conversation and exploration in a detailed summary;
   - auto-advances and clears context for the next step.
2. `plan-implementation` — `/skill:take-it-away-plan`, writes `implementation-plan.md`
   - converts the summary into one in-depth implementation plan;
   - emphasizes strict behavioral-red TDD and vertical slicing;
   - auto-advances and clears context for the next step.
3. `review-plan` — `/skill:take-it-away-review-plan`, updates `implementation-plan.md`
   - reviews and corrects the plan in place for TDD structure, slice quality, dependencies, validation, and blocked states;
   - auto-advances and clears context for the next step.
4. `implement-plan` — `/skill:implementor`
   - uses Ruleplementor's implementor skill to read `implementation-plan.md` and implement the change with strict TDD;
   - auto-advances and clears context for the next step.
5. `review-implementation` — `/skill:reviewer`, writes `implementation-review.md`
   - uses Ruleplementor's reviewer skill to review the current working tree against `implementation-plan.md`;
   - records findings, makes safe fixes for blocking and clear recommended issues, and completes the workflow.

### Smoke test

After discussing and exploring a smaller change with Pi, run:

```text
/wf:take-it-away demo
```

All steps are configured to auto-advance through summary, planning, plan review, implementation, and implementation review.

To hand off from an active flower in the same garden, start `take-it-away` without a new garden name:

```text
/wf:take-it-away
```

Workflower will create the next flower, for example `.pi/workflows/demo/0002-take-it-away/`, and include the previous flower's pollen paths in the kickoff prompt.

## Useful Workflower commands

```text
/wf status
/wf stop
/wf list
```

## GitHub publishing prerequisites

The final `new-feature` step uses the GitHub CLI from the current repository. Before running the workflow, ensure:

```bash
gh --version
gh auth status
```

The publishing skill creates any needed labels before creating issues. Generated labels are feature-specific and workflow-oriented, such as `feature:<slug>`, `mode:afk`, `mode:hitl`, and `stream:<name>`.
